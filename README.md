# Jarvis-AI-Python
J.A.R.V.I.S. AI Functionalities:
1. It should speak: The AI must have the ability to communicate verbally with users, ensuring natural and intuitive interactions.
2. It should listen: The system must be capable of accurately interpreting spoken inputs and commands.
3. It should fully understand everything and respond appropriately:The AI should have advanced natural language understanding to process and 
   interpret inputs in context, delivering accurate and meaningful responses.
4. It should be able to answer every question: The AI must provide accurate and well-informed answers to a wide range of user queries.
5. It should be able to perform tasks: The system must support task automation, such as executing commands, managing schedules, or controlling 
   connected devices.

# "Brain: The Decision-Making Model of J.A.R.V.I.S."
 The "Brain" of J.A.R.V.I.S. is the core decision-making model that handles various types of user queries. 
 It processes and categorizes inputs into three main types:

* General Queries: These involve basic or conversational interactions that do not require real-time data or task execution.
Examples:
"How are you?"
"What is photosynthesis?"
"I will talk to you tomorrow."

 * Real-Time Queries: These queries demand immediate information retrieval or real-time data.
Examples:
"Who is Elon Musk?"
"What’s Mark’s net worth?"
"What’s the weather outside?"

 * Automation Queries: These queries require the AI to perform specific tasks or execute actions.
Examples:
"Open Facebook and Instagram."
"Remind me when it’s 10 PM."
"Generate an image of Tony Stark."
